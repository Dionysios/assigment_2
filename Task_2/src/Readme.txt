Instructions

the assigment has two class
Library.java
Book1.java

Library has all the methods including the main.
I tried to comment all the methods so you could understand what I am doing in every class.
When you begin the program select the file (Books.txt).
After that everything happens automatically. The program reads the file and stores the data to an arraylist. After that the arraylist is either covert to object or string depending if the line has errors or not.
I have methods that check if the data (isbn, copyNumbers, etc ) are valid and I get the right error its time.
After that I store the object or the array with the errors and I write them to files.NewBooks for correct books and ErrorBooks for the wrong book.
 
Book1 is the object that the book.It's include the setters,getters and the constructor.
